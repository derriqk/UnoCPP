something may be broken especially for very rare uno cases where everyone is holding a bunch of cards leaving deck and discard to be really tiny and the game breaks!!!

lacking implementation of: 
  player saying uno when they have one card
  random starting player (always user atm)
  card stacking and special plays that youd see in other games
  let me know anything else
