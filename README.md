something may be broken especially for very rare uno cases where everyone is holding a bunch of cards leaving deck and discard to be really tiny and the game breaks!!!

lacking implementation of: 
<ul>
  <li>
    player saying uno when they have one card
  </li>
  <li>
    random starting player (always user atm)
  </li>
  <li>
    card stacking and special plays that youd see in other games
  </li>
  <li>
    let me know anything else
  </li>
</ul>
